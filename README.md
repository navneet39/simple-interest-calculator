# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple shell script to calculate the simple interest based on user inputs for principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

## How It Works

1. The script prompts the user to enter the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period in years.
2. It then calculates the simple interest using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{100}
   \]

3. Finally, it displays the calculated simple interest to the user.

## Requirements

- A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- `bash` shell
- `bc` command-line calculator

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x simple-interest.sh
